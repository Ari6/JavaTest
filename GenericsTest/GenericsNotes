Generics
	merits
	 You can
 		* protect runtime error with unexpected asign type
 		* make classes generic  
 
 	How back end works
 		C++ template makes many declaration but Java create just use Object and cast them.
 		
 	<> is after SE7
 	
 	You cannot do
 		* new
 		* instanceof
 		* .class
 		
 	You cannot use generics to static fields, method, and inner class.
 	
 	The wildcard can be used in a variety of situations: 
 	as the type of a parameter, field, or local variable; 
 	sometimes as a return type (though it is better programming practice to be more specific). 
 	The wildcard is never used as a type argument for a generic method invocation, a generic class instance creation, or a supertype.
 	
 	List<?> you cannot add elements because element type is not decided.
 	 * you cannot call method that has an argument with Type Parameter.
 	 
 	The type get from List<?> is Object type.
